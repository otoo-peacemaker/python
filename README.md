# Python

This README provides an overview of the Python topics discussed. It serves as a reference guide for understanding key concepts and syntax.

## 1. Data Types

### 1.1 Numeric Data Types
- **Integers:** Whole numbers without decimal points.
  Example: `x = 10`

- **Floating-Point Numbers:** Numbers with a decimal point or in exponential form.
  Example: `y = 3.14`

### 1.2 String Data Type
- A sequence of characters enclosed within single, double, or triple quotes.
  Example: `name = "John"`

### 1.3 Composite Data Types
- **Lists:** Ordered, mutable collections of items.
  Example: `my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]`

- **Tuples:** Ordered, immutable collections of items.
  Example: `my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)`

- **Dictionaries:** Unordered, mutable collections of key-value pairs.
  Example: `my_dict = {"name": "John", "age": 30}`

## 2. Control Flow

### 2.1 Conditionals
- **if-else Statements:** Execute code based on certain conditions.
  ```python
  if condition:
      # Code to execute if condition is True
  else:
      # Code to execute if condition is False
  ```

### 2.2 Loops
- **for Loops:** Iterate over a sequence and execute code for each item.
  ```python
  for item in sequence:
      # Code to execute for each item
  ```

- **while Loops:** Execute code repeatedly as long as a condition is True.
  ```python
  while condition:
      # Code to execute as long as condition is True
  ```
